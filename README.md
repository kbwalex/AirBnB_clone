## AirBnB clone part 1 - The console

### Project Description 
The AirBnB clone project is aimed at deploying on our server a simple copy of the [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com) website.

For the first part of this project, we are going to create a console using python cmd module to work on the backend. 

### Command Line Description 
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that it has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object  

### How to start it
Run the command below to start
```
$ ./console
```
